# Excel Project: Electric Vehicle Adoption in Washington State (US) [WIP]

## Personal Project

### Grade: N/A

## Introduction

This repository contains one of my earlier proper data projects, which I had done in anticipation of my Graduate Diploma of Data Science. Using my online reasearch and
self-teaching skills along with my already strong experience using Microsoft Excel, I constructed a dashboard on Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption across Washington State in
the United States. This required employing rigorous data cleaning and exploration procedures before creating the final dashboard, which consisted of a chloropleth map, a 
heat map, and an interactive bar chart.
