# Excel Project: Electric Vehicle Adoption in Washington [WIP]

## Personal Project

### Grade: N/A

## Introduction

This repository contains one of my earlier proper data projects, which I had done in anticipation of my Graduate Diploma of Data Science. Using my online reasearch and
self-teaching skills along with my already strong experience using Microsoft Excel, I constructed a dashboard on Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption across Washington State in
the United States. This required employing rigorous data cleaning and exploration procedures before creating the final dashboard, which consisted of a choropleth map, a 
heat map, and an interactive bar chart.

## Skills Used

- 🔠 **Microsoft Excel**: Conducted all operations, analysis, cleaning, visualisation and dashboard design using Excel features. This included the use of formulas, filters, Power Query, Power Pivot, conditional formatting, and advanced charting features.
- 📈 **Data Analysis**: Performed statistical measures and constructed visualisations to identify trends in variables. Performed univariate and multivariate analyses to find trends and relationships in data.
- 📊 **Data Visualisation/Dashboard Design**: Used visualisation design principles to design a dashboard that highlights the significance of individual data visualisations using position and size, and guided users to naturally view them in the intended order.
Selected appropriate usage of visualisations and colours that presented relevant information clearly without creating confusion.
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning**: Used Power Query to reduce data dimensionality and remove unused features. Used functions, filters, pivot tables, and scatter plots to identify outliers, missing values, impossible values, and univariate and multivariate errors to prevent low-quality data from affecting final project output.
- 📧 **Data Retrieval**: Identified suitable dataset of interest, and used Power Query operations to extract, load and transform the dataset for the project.
- 📐 **Problem-Solving**: Selected appropriate techniques for processing and analysis using a mixture of strong theoretical knowledge and a natural intuition based on real life experience.
- 🔍 **Attention to Detail**: Identified the presence and implications of trends, relationships, and outliers in the data.
- 🔬 **Research/Self-Learning**: Performed background research in electric vehicles and American geography to better understand relationships between features and help check coherence between location variables.
